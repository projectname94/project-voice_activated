# What is an Input? What is an output?

<!-- 

lecture notes:
preamble: contextualize this within class

at its core, all the work you'll be doing over the next 5 weeks revolve around inputting data and generating some sort of output.

this is fine, but we wanted to have a brief convo + share examples of what an input/output is. and where one ends and the other begins.


so what do we (as a class) want to define an input as?


 -->

## Input
[noun]
1. what is put in, taken in, or operated on by any process or system.


<!-- 
so that being an input, what's an ouput? 


 -->

## Output
Data *generated by a computer* is referred to as output. Data generated by a computer is referred to as output. This includes data produced at a software level, such as the result of a calculation [...]


<!-- 

what are some examples of outputs? 
- on the desktop?
- in the browser? 
- within html, css?
- within javascript?

a type of reaction to a command

 -->

Examples of data generated in our class:
- a `class` added to a `div`
- a `css` property being changed
- elements being appended to or removed from the DOM
- a new window being opened


<!-- 

some examples we're excited about!
