10 heuristics

FAVORITE:
#4: Consistency and standards
	it allows for a frameworkâ€”repeated visits, etc
	provides a context for how to use all other pieces


also #9 might be important in speech bc prone to errors


REMOVE:
#8 because of vague-ness, semantics, etc
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.


ADD:
Friendliness (2020):
which parts are most relevant for the system
+ how to facilitate which parts might be most relevant for current track of user


Voice User Interfaces

FAV:
Show the system status.
most difficult to do, esp when something is invisible

REMOVE:
Be consistent and follow standards.
there is an opportunity to establish those standards
- blade runner enhance scene
	- not a great interface, but doesn't have a personality
	- also, replicants are a personality and leads to all sorts of trouble

- newness and novelty should be enhanced/exploratory interface. 
	- failure shouldnt be a deterent bc we have visual /GUI safeguards

ADD:
identify utility of omnipresent assistent vs toggle on
- persistent listening "always on"
