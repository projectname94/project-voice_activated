# States of Feedback

enabling a person to discover or learn something for themselves.

For us, an i/o interaction contains 5 distinct states that hopefully facilitate a heuristic interface.

## 1. Showing Ready State
Before a user can begin an interaction they need to know that the computer is listening and that they will be acknowledged. Apple's Siri interface uses an audio cue to indicate it is ready.

<!-- Video (Screen Recording) -->
## 2. Begin an input
While a user is speaking to their device, there should be some sort of indication that they are being listened to. For example, Siri provides a subtle animation.

## 3. Acknowledge received input
After the input has been completed there is an indication that it is being processed. Siri will display the text that it is processing on your screen to show you what it is responding too.

## 4. Show output
Outputs can exist in many forms, Siri will both dictate part of it's response and show additional options on the screen.

## 5. Error state
Simply put, error states should indicate to a user that their interaction cannot be completed. However, in speech based interfaces, there is the possibility of the error state to be non-intrusive to the interaction. Siri will in some instances opt to google what you have said if it doesn't understand or cannot perform your requested command.
