# Voice Activated Interfaces

## Brief
While speaking to your houseplants is recommended and untangling headphones might lead to shouts of exasperation, the majority of our day-to-day interactions with &ldquo;things&rdquo; are non-verbal.

Select a non-verbal interaction (digital or physical) and introduce a layer of voice activation. Consider how this introduction enhances (or limits) the interaction: 
- How does our expectation of how it should (re)act change?
- How does our expectation of how we should (re)act towards it change? 
- What visual cues do you need to introduce to suggest this new layer?
- What (if any) audio cues do you need to introduce?

Over the next two weeks you will conceptualize, prototype, and refine a voice activated interface. You may use one of the existing input/output projects as a starting point for this project.

### Alternative
If you have a specific project idea that you&rsquo;d like to realize over the next two weeks that doesn&rsquo;t fit the prompt, feel free to propose it!
