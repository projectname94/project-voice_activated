# input / output

## Brief:

The goal of this assignment is to create a collection of audio-based input/outputs with Javascript for everyone to refine and reference over the course of this workshop. Over the next few weeks, we will be using these i/o's as a starting point for critiques and discussions on what a cross-sensory interaction can be.


For next week you will create 5 separate i/o sketches, each exploring a different type of speech-based input and visual output.

A few examples include:
-


## Requirements:
- Each sketch should have its own directory (you can just make 5 copies of the boilerplate)
- Each sketch should have some sort of command or input
- Each sketch should somehow process and reveal an output



## Context:
### Interaction:
	- How do you begin an input
	- show ready state
	- Acknowledge received input
	- show output
	- Error state


## Goals:
- revisit javascript
- get acquainted with the library
- explore a simple audio input interaction
- iteration: rough sketches of simple ideas: a repository of interactions
