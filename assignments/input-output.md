# input / output

## Brief:
The goal of this assignment is to create a collection of audio-based input/outputs with Javascript for everyone to refine and reference over the course of this workshop. Over the next few weeks, we will be using these i/o's as a starting point for critiques and discussions on what a cross-sensory interaction can be.


For next week you will create 5 separate input/output sketches, each exploring a different type of speech-based input and visual output.

A few examples include:
- 1
- 2
- 3


## Requirements:
- Each sketch should have its own directory (you can just make 5 copies of the boilerplate)
- Each sketch should have some sort of command or input
- Each sketch should somehow process and reveal an output

## Context:
For this class, we want to break down an interaction into the following steps:

1. How do you begin an input
2. Show ready state
3. Acknowledge received input
4. Show output
5. Error state

For the _first week_ of this assignment, we will be focusing on steps 1 and 4.


## Goals:
- revisit javascript
- get acquainted with the library
- explore a simple audio input interaction
- iteration: rough sketches of simple ideas: a repository of interactions
