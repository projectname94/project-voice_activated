# new voices 

## Brief:
During your break go outside and find a brand, store, or logo to translate into a voice interaction. Quite often designers refer to a visual identities tone or voice, yet in most cases, an actual vocal interaction is not present. The goal of this assignment is to capture the brand through a selection of input commands and visual outputs.

## Requirements:
- Select and document your brand with a camera, audio recording, or pen/pencil sketch. This will provide a reference for your coded exercise.
- Create at least 3 commands that the website will respond to, with a different visual output for each one.

## Context:
This project is meant to open a line of inquiry into how we can introduce the voice into otherwise visual interactions. What would someone have to say to a brand in order to engage with it? How would the brand respond?
