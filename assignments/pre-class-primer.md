# pre-class exercise
The upcoming workshop (Voice Activated) will be using html, css, and javascript to create *messy* sketches exploring how oral language and spoken commands can be used to create novel and meaningful web-based interactions. 

We realize that the degree of comfort with code for each student might vary greatly. This is why we have made all of the assignments group-based and have made a boilerplate template to get everyone started. Hopefully this will help facilitate an encouraging environment in which you all can pool together your knowledge and expertise. The goal in this workshop is to make proof-of-concept work that engages in a classroom-wide conversation.

_For next week_, we have a small primer assignment:

Please download this boilerplate and Sublime Text 3. 

In the boilerplate, we've already added a simple button in your html and an event-handler in your javascript. For next week, make this button do something to your html. It can add a new piece of html, reveal a piece of html, or just change the way your button or the webpage looks.

If this is your first exposure to html/css/javascript, don't worry! Take a look at the folder you've downloaded in your Finder. Notice the filetypes: you have an index.html and an assets folder with a main.css (your css file where you define how things look) and a script.js (your javascript file, where you will be writing actual code). If you double click on your index.html file, it'll open in the browser. If you drag the entire folder into your Sublime text app, you can begin to edit it.
